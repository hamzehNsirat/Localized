        Configure db.js to set up PostgreSQL integration using Sequelize ORM.

##     [Authentication] & [Authorization] (CFR1, CFR2, CFR5)

        - Files: authRoutes.js, authController.js, User.js, authService.js, authMiddleware.js

        - Description: Implement user registration, login, and logout, incorporating access control based on user roles.

        - Endpoint Exposure: /auth/login, /auth/signup, /auth/logout

        - Testing: Validate login, signup, and role-based access control.

        - Frontend Integration: Expose authentication endpoints for front-end login and signup forms.

##     [User] Dashboard & [Access] Control (CFR3, CFR7)

        - Files: dashboardRoutes.js, dashboardController.js

        - Description: Serve dashboards based on user roles (Admin, Retailer, Supplier).

        - Endpoint Exposure: /dashboard

        - Testing: Mock tests to ensure users are routed to the correct dashboard.

        - Frontend Integration: Connect front-end navigation to backend role-based dashboards.

##     [Admin] Functionalities (SAFR1-SA9)

        - Files: adminRoutes.js, adminController.js, User.js, Complaint.js

        - Description: Build functionalities for user management (CRUD), application review, penalty application, and complaint viewing.

        - Endpoint Exposure: /admin/users, /admin/complaints

        - Testing: Unit tests for each admin function to ensure reliability.

        - Frontend Integration: Admin dashboard functionalities connected to endpoints for user management, complaints, and penalties.

##     [Retailer] Functionalities (RFR1-RFR19)

        - Files: retailerRoutes.js, retailerController.js, Product.js, Quotation.js, Order.js

        - Description: Enable retailers to view accounts, search marketplaces, save favorite listings, manage quotations, and escalate issues.

        - Endpoint Exposure: /retailer/quotations, /retailer/orders, /retailer/feedback

        - Testing: Tests for product searches, quotations, and orders.

        - Frontend Integration: Integrate retailer dashboard, search, and quotation requests with frontend modules.

##     [Supplier] Functionalities (SFR1-SRF22)

        - Files: supplierRoutes.js, supplierController.js, Product.js, Quotation.js

        - Description: Provide suppliers with features like managing products, quotations, and order monitoring.

        - Endpoint Exposure: /supplier/products, /supplier/quotations, /supplier/orders

        - Testing: Validate supplier-specific actions like product uploading and order status checks.

        - Frontend Integration: Supplier dashboard integration for product management and quotation responses.

##     [Service] Layer (Business Logic & Complex Operations)

        - Files: productService.js, quotationService.js, orderService.js

        - Description: Centralize complex business logic like processing quotations, handling orders, and managing feedback.

        - Testing: Service-level unit tests to ensure isolated business logic correctness.

##     [Notification] Services (Email for Interactions)

        - Files: emailService.js

        - Description: Send emails for important actions (quotation requests, order updates).

        - Endpoint Exposure: Exposed indirectly through service events.

        - Testing: Mock tests for email dispatch.

        - Frontend Integration: Trigger email notifications for interactions requiring confirmation.

##     [ErrorHandling] and Global Middleware

        - Files: errorHandler.js, authMiddleware.js

        - Description: Implement centralized error handling and authorization checks.

        - Testing: Inject faulty data to test error responses.

##     [Final] [Integration] [Testing]

        - Conduct end-to-end tests across modules to confirm that each module integrates smoothly within the cyclic development cycle.

##     [Preparing] the Backend for REST API Calls

        - Middleware Configuration: In app.js, add CORS, JSON parsing, and error-handling middleware.

        - API Documentation: Use tools like Swagger to document API endpoints for frontend developers.

        - Data Validation: Use middleware (like Joi or Validator) to ensure data integrity for each request.

        - Testing Endpoints: Test REST endpoints using Postman, confirming each endpoint responds as expected and interacts correctly with the database and other services.

        - Deployment: Deploy the backend to a cloud provider and configure it for public access to integrate with the frontend and ensure accessibility for collaborative development.
