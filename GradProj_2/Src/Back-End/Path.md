# Update
## Interrelation of Components

* Here’s how each main component connects and contributes to representing the functional requirements in a holistic way:

- Authentication: authController.js, authRoutes.js, authService.js, and authMiddleware.js collectively manage user login, signup, and access control. Authentication allows access to dashboards, products, orders, and other features based on user roles (Admin, Retailer, Supplier), covering CFR1, CFR2, CFR5, and CFR7.

- Role-Based Dashboards: dashboardController.js and dashboardRoutes.js load dashboards based on user roles, allowing users to view personalized content and analytics, fulfilling CFR3 and SAFR1-SA9, RFR4, SFR22.

- Product Management: productController.js, productRoutes.js, and productService.js allow Retailers to search the marketplace and Suppliers to manage their products, fulfilling RFR7-RFR15, SFR3-SFR9.

- Quotation Management: quotationController.js, quotationRoutes.js, quotationService.js enable the request, approval, and monitoring of quotations, meeting requirements like RFR3, RFR10, RFR12, SAFR2, SAFR7.

- Order Management: orderController.js, orderRoutes.js, and orderService.js manage orders, monitoring their lifecycle from creation to fulfillment, covering SAFR3, SAFR9, RFR16-RFR19, and SFR15.

- Notifications and Analytics: These components work as scheduled jobs (cron jobs) to send reminders, updates, and analytics summaries. Notifications (CFR4, RFR9, SFR10, SFR11) help users stay informed, while Analytics (SAFR6, RFR9, SFR10, SFR11) provide insights.

- Complaints and Reviews: complaintController.js and reviewController.js allow users to manage feedback and complaints, covering RFR17-RFR18, SAFR9, SFR14, SFR21.

This modular structure ensures each functional requirement has a clear implementation path, with components designed to work together in a cohesive manner.

## Topological Sorting of Files

        * Here’s a topologically sorted list of files based on their dependencies, starting from essential backbone files to those with the least dependencies. This ordering reflects the order in which each part of the project should ideally be developed.
